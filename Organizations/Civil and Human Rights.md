We believe police violence and exploitation cannot be ended through reforms (better trained, better monitored, more friendly cops) but only with the total abolition of the police as an institution. ... this is because police forces maintain the inequalities of capitalist society, and will continue to be violent and racist as long as they exist." |

We believe that basic necessities such as food, shelter, and freedom are what really make our communities secure. As such, our work is part of global struggles against inequality and powerlessness.

We recognize this work is long overdue and believe it is particularly urgent in this political moment, as racism and misogyny drive white men to contend for, and consolidate, power with increasing violence. We mobilize white men who acknowledge our complicity in perpetuating oppression, who understand our mutual interest in ending cis-white male supremacy, and who are ready to take bold action to dismantle the white supremacist patriarchal system. We seek to disrupt both the structural, organized and interpersonal violence of white men wherever that violence emerges, while engaging in the rigorous internal work of unlearning white supremacy and patriarchy within ourselves. We seek to support, and be accountable in this work to the leadership of women, trans and gender nonbinary folks; folks who are Indigenous, Black, and People of Color; and especially to those in that intersection." |
