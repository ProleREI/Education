Within the scope of our use of the term “anarchism” we have been quite broad, but broad does not mean infinite, and basically shrinks down to a set of ideas against the State and the capital."|

As we enter into periods of capitalist crisis, the rise of the far-right will continue to be a threat, and we intend to provide news and analysis that can be useful to organizers and anti-racists." |
| [Burnt Ends Press](https://burntendspress.wordpress.com/) | "Burnt Ends Press is a small anarchist publisher of mostly history-focused or archival texts, some of which we’ve authored ourselves, some of which we’ve lovingly tried to revive from the forgotten archives of Past’s decay. We’re primarily interested in the ongoing dilemma of southern history and memory; self-defense and armed struggle; race, critical race theory, and afro-pessimist thought; the development of and resistance to capitalism, the state, and their ongoing processes of primitive accumulation; social reproduction and gender; and anti-prison struggles on both sides of the wall. Formerly and affectionately known as the North Carolina Piece Corps." |
| [Haymarket Books](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/) | "Haymarket Books is a radical, independent, nonprofit book publisher based in Chicago, a project of the Center for Economic Research and Social Change." |

| [Online University of the Left](http://www.ouleft.org/) | "We are a free and open university with all the diverse views on the left. We are inspired by Karl Marx, whose ideas are a common touchstone for many people working for change. His historical materialism, his many contributions to political economy and class analysis, all continue to serve our core values -the self-emancipation of the working class and a vision of a classless society. There are naturally many trends in Marxism that have developed over the years, and new ones are on the rise today. All of them, and other radicals and progressives who want to see this project succeed, are welcome here. " |

| [Syndicalism.org](https://syndicalism.org/) | "Our inspiration comes from places like The Anarchist Library, libcom.org, and the Kate Sharpley Library. However, we intend — as you might imagine — to focus solely on syndicalism. We believe that syndicalism offers the most hope for a path out of capitalism and towards a more libertarian world. As a small contribution towards that goal, we aim to gather materials that define and promote the syndicalist method, as well as texts related to the history of syndicalism." |

This means that we have a lot of zines on direct action, organizing, starting projects (ex: collectives, study groups, prisoner support projects), decision-making, street tactics, security, affinity groups, how we relate to each other, etc." |

Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend." |
