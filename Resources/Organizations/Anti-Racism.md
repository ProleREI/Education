| Anti-Racism Organizations | Description |
|-|-|
| [BREAKING THE PREJUDICE HABIT](http://breakingprejudice.org/)| "We are dedicated to breaking the habit of prejudice and discrimination. We are working together to overcome these social issues by spreading awareness of the problem, establishing harmony between groups, and promoting acceptance of differences." |
| [Crossroads](http://crossroadsantiracism.org/)| "Crossroads’ mission is to equip institutions with shared language, frameworks, practices and tools that will assist them in; 1. Diagnosing how their institutions are structured to uphold white supremacy culture and systemic racism and; 2. Deploying strategies aimed at animating antiracist ways of being that result in racially equitable institutional culture and practices" |
| [Educating for Equity - Ali Michael, Ph.D.](https://alimichael.org/)| "Though my work is rooted in academia, I focus my efforts on making the research on race and education more accessible to teachers. Most of our academic research is literally tucked away in journals that most teachers can't access without a university library card. My goal is to produce books, articles, speeches, and blogposts that will help the research come alive in a way that educators can access, so that they can begin to transform their classrooms and schools into racially equitable spaces."|
| [Jane Elliot](https://janeelliott.com/)| "Jane Elliott, internationally known teacher, lecturer, diversity trainer, and recipient of the National Mental Health Association Award for Excellence in Education, exposes prejudice and bigotry for what it is, an irrational class system based upon purely arbitrary factors. And if you think this does not apply to you. . . you are in for a rude awakening."|
| [SHOWING UP FOR RACIAL JUSTICE](https://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/) | "SURJ is a national network of groups and individuals working to undermine white supremacy and to work for racial justice. Through community organizing, mobilizing, and education, SURJ moves white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority for justice with passion and accountability. We work to connect people across the country while supporting and collaborating with local and national racial justice organizing efforts. SURJ provides a space to build relationships, skills and political analysis to act for change." |
| [Teaching Tolerance](https://www.tolerance.org/)| "Teaching Tolerance provides free resources to educators—teachers, administrators, counselors and other practitioners—who work with children from kindergarten through high school. Educators use our materials to supplement the curriculum, to inform their practices, and to create civil and inclusive school communities where children are respected, valued and welcome participants." |
| [The Race Card Project](https://theracecardproject.com/)| "In 2010, journalist Michele Norris began inviting people to distill their thoughts on the word race to only six words. Printing 200 postcards and issuing a call to action, Norris and her team were unsure of what – if anything – would result. What took root was a groundswell. With just a small footprint, it was clear Norris created a vehicle for expression and voice for which it seemed many were longing."|
| [Tim Wise](http://www.timwise.org/about/)| "Tim Wise, whom scholar and philosopher Cornel West calls, “A vanilla brother in the tradition of (abolitionist) John Brown,” is among the nation’s most prominent antiracist essayists and educators. He has spent the past 25 years speaking to audiences in all 50 states, on over 1000 college and high school campuses, at hundreds of professional and academic conferences, and to community groups across the nation. He has also lectured internationally in Canada and Bermuda, and has trained corporate, government, law enforcement and medical industry professionals on methods for dismantling racism in their institutions." |
| [UN - Lets Fight Racism](https://www.un.org/en/letsfightracism/)| UN Anti-Racism Resources |
| [White Ally Toolkit](https://www.whiteallytoolkit.com/)| "The White Ally Toolkit/Ally Conversation Toolkit helps white anti-racism allies do their part in the fight against racism. We empower and equip them with the RACE Method, a unique and effective approach we have designed from best practices of non-violent communication (listening, storytelling, and compassion) and the neuroscience of persuasion. Using the RACE Method, white anti-racism allies become more persuasive in conversations with racism skeptics (people who are skeptical that racism against people of color is a real problem) and can positively influence them." |
| [White Nonsense Roundup](https://whitenonsenseroundup.com/)| "White Nonsense Roundup (WNR) was created by white people, for white people, to address our inherently racist society. We believe it is our responsibility to call out white friends, relatives, contacts, speakers, and authors who are contributing to structural racism and harming our friends of color. We are a resource for anti-racist images, links, videos, artwork, essays, and voices. These can be used by anyone for a DIY white nonsense roundup, or by the WNR team to support people of color upon their request." |
| [Zinn Education Project](https://www.zinnedproject.org/) | "The Zinn Education Project promotes and supports the teaching of people’s history in classrooms across the country. For more than ten years, the Zinn Education Project has introduced students to a more accurate, complex, and engaging understanding of history than is found in traditional textbooks and curricula." |
