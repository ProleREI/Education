| Scientific Organizations | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [American Academy of Arts and Sciences](https://www.amacad.org/) | "The Academy is both an honorary society that recognizes and celebrates the excellence of its members and an independent research center convening leaders from across disciplines, professions, and perspectives to address significant challenges."| 
| [Camilo Mora Lab](http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/index.html) | "The Mora lab focuses on interconnected lines of research aimed to understand how biodiversity patterns are generated and modified by human activities and in the process identifying the conditions where suitable conditions for both, humans and biodiversity, are met." |
| [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/) | "The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the environment." |
| [Federation of American Sciences](https://fas.org/) | "The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) provides science-based analysis of and solutions to protect against catastrophic threats to national and international security. Specifically, FAS works to reduce the spread and number of nuclear weapons, prevent nuclear and radiological terrorism, promote high standards for nuclear energy’s safety and security, illuminate government secrecy practices, as well as prevent the use of biological and chemical weapons." |
| [The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/) | "The IPCC provides regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for adaptation and mitigation." |
| [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov/) | "NASA's Vision: To discover and expand knowledge for the benefit of humanity."|
| [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) | "NCBI's mission is to develop new information technologies to aid in the understanding of fundamental molecular and genetic processes that control health and disease. More specifically, the NCBI has been charged with creating automated systems for storing and analyzing knowledge about molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics; facilitating the use of such databases and software by the research and medical community; coordinating efforts to gather biotechnology information both nationally and internationally; and performing research into advanced methods of computer-based information processing for analyzing the structure and function of biologically important molecules." |
| [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) | "NCEI is responsible for hosting and providing access to one of the most significant archives on Earth, with comprehensive oceanic, atmospheric, and geophysical data. From the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun and from million-year-old ice core records to near real-time satellite images, NCEI is the Nation’s leading authority for environmental information." |
|[Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/)| "Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. We provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data alongside powerful analytic and visualization tools for use by the community. Our goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response."|
| [NOVA](https://www.pbs.org/nova/) | "NOVA is the most-watched prime time science series on American television, reaching an average of five million viewers weekly. Now in its fifth decade of production, the series remains committed to producing in-depth science programming in the form of one-hour documentaries and long-form mini-series, from the latest breakthroughs in technology to the deepest mysteries of the natural world. NOVA is produced by WGBH Boston and airs Wednesday nights at 9/8c on most PBS stations." |
| [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ ) | "PubMed comprises more than 30 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. Citations may include links to full-text content from PubMed Central and publisher web sites." |
| [Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu) | "The Smithsonian Institution is the world’s largest museum, education, and research complex, with 19 museums and the National Zoo—shaping the future by preserving our heritage, discovering new knowledge, and sharing our resources with the world." |
| [State Of the Climate - NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/) | "The State of the Climate is a collection of monthly summaries recapping climate-related occurrences on both a global and national scale." |
