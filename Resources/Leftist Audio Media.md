The show's creators published The Chapo Guide to Revolution in August 2018, with the book debuting at number six on The New York Times Best Seller list.(Wikipedia)" |

It is our struggles which have shaped our world, and any improvement in our conditions has been won by years of often violent conflict and sacrifice. This project is dedicated to all those who have struggled in the past for a better world, and who continue to do so now. To help record and popularise our grassroots, people’s history, as opposed to the top-down accounts of most history books." |
